nukesilverlight
===============

Run as:
sudo sh nukesilverlight.sh

* Removes Silverlight plugin.
* Mounts Silverlight Disk Image (expected to be in ~/Downloads).
* Installs Silverlight in /.
* Unmounts Silverlight Disk Image from /Volumes.

Why? Because when I open Netflix in Firefox it bricks my Silverlight install. This makes is quick and easy to reinstall.
